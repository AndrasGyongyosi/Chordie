# Chordie
Dear Visitor! At first I would introduce myself. I am Andras Gyongyosi, former student of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. I learned Computer Science just like my brother, Peter. We both love music, I play guitar, Peter is good at lot of instrument, but I define him as a pianist. This website is our product, and my diploma project, Chordie. Our goal is to help other musician to learn new chords, try other tunings. I hope you will enjoy the site and you will think of it as useful.
